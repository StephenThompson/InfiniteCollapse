Resources:
All resources (textures, models, sounds, etc) should be placed in a subfolder in the Assets folder called Resources and uploaded to a seperate storage location such as Google drive. Only scripts, scene files and the unity project files should be uploaded to the repository.

Scenes:
Everyone should work in seperate scenes until their work is ready to be merged into the actual scene.
